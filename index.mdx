## Sending Money via Crypto

Sending money home shouldn't eat into the amount your loved ones actually receive. That's why we've built crypto transfers into Yara—it's simply a faster, cheaper way to move money. When you send through traditional banks, your transfer can bounce between multiple intermediaries, each taking a cut and adding delays. With crypto, especially stablecoins like USDC and USDT, your money moves directly and settles in minutes.
